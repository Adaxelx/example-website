## Photo gallery page

This page imitates something like portfolio for photographer. 


### Motivation

In this page mainly I was testing new technology which I discovered: gsap. It is tool for animations. Every animation in this page is created by gsap. 

Structure and code not matching with my actual preferings but that days I was discovering my preference about actual structure of code (and probably I didn't know hooks yet ;) )

### Folder structure

 - components : main components on pages.
 - templates : just pages (idk why I used that name).
 - images : I think this dont have to be explained.
 - theme : Global styles and themes for React context.
